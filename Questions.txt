1) Scan Points are displayed in black by PointCloudViewer. 
PointCloudProto has a member called colors, but how can I configure 
that if I can't assure that each scan has exactly the same number 
of points? In addition to that, output range can be configured. 
Thus, doing it in app.json seems impractical to me. Can I access
the point cloud after it has been converted from scan?
Could I bind color to intensity?

N.b. struct PointCloudProto {
  # The positions of the ->> poinst <<--

2. Can I move the camera within PointCloudViewer? Measure? 

3. Isn't there a better way to set up the path to Isaac SDK?

4. A 2D range scan which is essentially a flat version of the 3D RangeScanProto
struct FlatscanProto {
 a)   ->> FlatScanProto <<-

 b) no not really, and why isn't it? (I miss struct Ray or at least an intensity list)

5. In case the connection is lost - shall the driver try to reconnect and transmit Dist=Invalid once
or reportFailure and let the framework / user handle? I think the driver should provide both options
but is there a preference?
